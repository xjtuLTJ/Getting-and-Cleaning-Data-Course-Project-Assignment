Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
==================================================================
The tidy data set for analysis is derived from the Samsung Smartphones dataset from this link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The run_analysis.R takes the datasets from the link and does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The resulting 69 variables are described below: 



1 id num 
  Record ID 
    [1,180]

2 subjectid num 
  Subject ID 
    [1,30]

  Activity completed 
    WALKING
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    SITTING
    STANDING
